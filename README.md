Data integration process management made easy!

ProcessTracker builds a standard framework that is tool agnostic.  If you are working with data integration/cleansing/enriching 
processes then this framework can help manage dependencies between processes and provide auditing capabilities without 
having to parse logs or build your own framework.

To learn more about how to use ProcessTracker, please check out our documentation on [ReadTheDocs][1]!
