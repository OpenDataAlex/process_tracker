ProcessTracker
##############


ProcessTracker is a framework for managing data integration processes.

The home for ProcessTracker is on `GitHub <https://github.com/OpenDataAlex/process_tracker/>`_ .

The goal of ProcessTracker is to provide an easy to use framework for auditing and managing data integration processes
and their data.  This framework has been developed over many iterations and years.

While the initial focus has been on process and data extract management, other features will likely be added
and improved.

We are always looking for new feature requests, bugs, and other contributions!  To learn more on how to contribute,
please refer to our :doc:`Contributing <./contributing>` page.  To see what is on the roadmap,
please check out our `Issue Board <https://github.com/OpenDataAlex/process_tracker/issues?state=open>`_.

ProcessTracker is being developed for many different languages/tools.  Please refer to the :doc:`Implementations <./intro/other_implementations>` page.
